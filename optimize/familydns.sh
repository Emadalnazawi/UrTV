#   optimize/dock.sh familydns on       ask the home app to switch it on (it checks the service can be reached, records what the TV had,
#                                       sets it, checks the internet works through it, and puts the old values back if not)
#   optimize/dock.sh familydns off      the app puts back exactly what the TV had (a value that was not set is deleted)
#   optimize/dock.sh familydns status   on or off, who switched it
#   optimize/dock.sh familydns grant    give the home app the permission it needs (recorded; reset.sh takes it back)
# The home app (sa.urtv.home, a version with this feature) is required: the whole job runs on the TV, so a dropped connection or a closed
# window here cannot leave the TV half switched, and there is one record, the app's. (A background job started from here would not
# survive on every TV: some end it with the ADB session, so there is no script-side fallback.) Run optimize/install.sh launcher first.
