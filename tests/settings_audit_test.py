"""The other settings the tools change besides the tweaks: measure.sh stretches the TV's screen-off timeout while it reads, and
dock.sh sleep-setup turns on an accessibility service. Each puts back what the TV had (null: deleted, not a guess), also after a
run that died, and says so with a !! line when the TV does not take the value. Fake TVs; no TV needed.
