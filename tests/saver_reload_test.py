"""A screensaver that is already on the screen starts over when a SET saves something (the first `optimize/start-saver.sh` after
`optimize/saver.sh city <new>` showed the previous city: the page reads its settings once, when it starts, and a dream that was
already running kept the old ones). Read from the source, as the apps need Android: SaverReceiver.set sends Prefs.CHANGED to the app
itself after saving, and the dream and the preview listen while they are on the screen and build a fresh page.   Run: python3 tests/saver_reload_test.py"""
